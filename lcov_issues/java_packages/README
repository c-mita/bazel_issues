## Checks for coverage across packages

There was strange behaviour where
`blaze coverage //java_packages/bar:all --combined_report=lcov`
would not output coverage for foo.LibFoo (depended on by LibBar).

It turns out this is just a strange outcome of the --instrumentation_filter
setting's default behaviour (there are heuristics when no setting is passed to
determine which things to instrument).

`blaze coverage //java_packages/bar:all --combined_report=lcov --insturmentaion_filter=".*"`
works as expected.

The bazel docs could do with clarefication.
